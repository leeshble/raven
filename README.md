# Raven

**Raven** is an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enhances LLM performance by grounding answers in domain-specific or private knowledge. Inspired by the ravenâ€™s symbolic wisdom and precision, this system delivers accurate, context-aware responses to complex queries.

## Features

-  **Contextual Search**: Hybrid retrieval combining dense & sparse embeddings (e.g., FAISS + BM25)
-  **Custom Knowledge Base**: Easily ingest files, URLs, databases, or APIs
-  **LLM Integration**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source models like LLaMA, Mistral
-  **Safe & Filtered Responses**: Configurable output filtering and prompt-guardrails
-  **Modular Design**: Plug-and-play architecture for retrievers, chunkers, and vector stores
